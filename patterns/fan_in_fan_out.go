/*
The merge function converts a list of channels to a single channel by starting a goroutine for each inbound channel that copies the values to the sole outbound channel.
Once all the output goroutines have been started, merge starts one more goroutine to close the outbound channel after all sends on that channel are done.
Sends on a closed channel panic, so itâ€™s important to ensure all sends are done before calling close. The sync.WaitGroup type provides a simple way to arrange this synchronization:
*/

func merge(cs ...<-chan int) <-chan int {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	out := make(chan int)

	// Start an output goroutine for each input channel in cs.  output
	// copies values from c to out until c is closed, then calls wg.Done.
	output := func(c <-chan int) {
		for n := range c {
			out <- n
		}
		wg.Done()
	}

	wg.Add(len(cs))

	for _, c := range cs {
		go output(c)
	}

	// Start a goroutine to close out once all the output goroutines are
	// done.  This must start after the wg.Add call.
	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(out)
	}()

	return out
}

func FanInFanOut(nums ...int) {
	in := gen(2, 3)

	// Distribute the sq work across two goroutines that both read from in.
	c1 := sq(in)
	c2 := sq(in)

	//Consumer the merged output from c1 and c2
	for n := range merge(c1, c2) {
		fmt.Println(n) // 4 then 9, or 9 then 4
	}
}

/*
There is a pattern to our pipeline functions:

- stages close their outbound channels when all the send operations are done.
- stages keep receiving values from inbound channels until those channels are closed
